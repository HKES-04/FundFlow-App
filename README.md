### What I learned

Through the development of FundFlow, my bank app project, I've gained invaluable experience in enhancing my DOM skills in JavaScript. This project challenged me to manipulate and interact with web page elements dynamically, which significantly improved my ability to create a seamless and responsive user interface. Additionally, FundFlow allowed me to practice working with arrays extensively, as I needed to manage user accounts, transactions, and loan requests efficiently. Overall, this project has not only deepened my understanding of web development but also reinforced my proficiency in handling data structures and enhancing user experiences.
